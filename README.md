Zotero picker script

extremly simple (probably messy) script allowing to use Zotero picker anywhere.

Requires:
- [Betterbibtex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex)
- [ydotool](https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool)
- Zotero (obviously)
It's set for pandoc citation format within brackets.
I'm running it with keyboard shortuct set in GNOME settings (Fedora 38, GNOME 44).

Feel free to upgrade it.
